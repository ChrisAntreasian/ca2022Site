I’m on the ramp. Palms have grown damp, as I try to keep my pants dry.  \nThe time I spent waiting, while holding it and pontificating, was about nothing but I survived.  \n\nOnly three more streets until I can finally re-meet, and smile at my family in the eyes.  \nBut the slowing SUV ahead suggests the light is turning red. My bladder quakes terrorized.  \n\nWhy Time? Go! Time you move too slow!  \nHow could you change that light right now?  \nCould my plight fall on deaf ears somehow?  \n\nWhy Time? Go! Time you move so slow!  \nCan’t this SUV just move along?  \nGet out of my way, where it belongs!  \n\nHopes for the future nearly pass. Dwindling progress in relapse. I force my mind from looking into the void.  \nSteal machine begins advancing. Stagnant moment finally passing. This inaction was always transitory.  \n\nThe SUV signals they're taking a right, peeling away out of my sight. Gas pedal beneath my foot implores.  \nOnly space and time lay in my way. Home’s aligned precedently. Pressure’s release is now in store.  \n\nStarting slowly, moving faster, time slows down, I’m a laser blaster.  \nFinally coming up to speed, burning petrol to fulfill my deepest need.  \nNo cars before me, open road, puff of smoke, my speed explodes.  \nQuickness now be, the only freedom I see, gasses fuming de-leaded notoriety.  \nLeast now I'm nearly home, anthropogenic omnicide pails to my need for a bathroom.  \nEarth as well may ignite, animals drowning, passing plight, as only this urge I can fight.  \nBurning power to fulfill my imploring yearn. Planet earth is going to have to wait its fucking turn.  \n*So long as my inside water wants to make its way out!*  \n\nGo Time? Go! Time you move too slow!  \nImpatient torment haunting me.  \nNearest future I will never see.  \n\nGo Time? Go! Time you move so slow!  \nSpeed of light, a pesky constant.  \nSlow that down, I’m at my faucet.   \n\nCreeping hault; a nightmare ahead. God, no. Why? The light is red. Laughter ripples through the void.  \nDeeply holding my gasping breath, break lines reluctantly compress. My idling vehicle now missemployed.  \n\nSanctuary now, so close by. Pass this intersection, then I’m just shy. Will wavering, continues to disappear.  \nUncomfortable moments can not be, imagining times not needing to pee. Indigent still I must persevere.  \n\nWhy Time? Go! Time you move so slow!  \nSpace is stuck, my plancks are passing.  \nPersistent halt inaction maddens.  \n\nGo Time? Go! Time you move so slow!  \nSpeed and time must now invert.  \nMy wheels and hopes stalled in the dirt.  \n\nNot yet home but nearly there. All patience dissolved from distressed wetware. I lurch forward, taking all the space.  \nDreams of a green light finally true. Instinctively knowing the only thing to do. Human urges I must now outrace.  \n\nInching forward, wheels are spinning, screeching noises, people seeing.  \nBurning rubber, smoking odors, friction now caught by screaming motors.  \nA sinking feeling, as g-force rise. Slow down safely for some kids outside.  \nRight turn clear, I’m nearly home. Cut the wheel, add gas and speed down the road.   \nSwerving into the driveway barely alive. Throw the car door open almost leaving the keys inside.  \nFull speed leaping, tripping over knees so stiff. My entire arduous journey has led up to this.  \nSprint up the stairs, lunging forward to unlock the front door. The nightmare is finally over.  \n*Until I drop my keys on the floor!*  \n\nCould it be? Me, so painfully waiting to pee?  \nMy strength is spent. The key is too far.  \nOverwhelming urges, should have gone in the car.  \n\nCould it be? Me, so horribly needing to pee?  \nLegs quake violently, as I dare lean over.  \nLaughing echoes humming near the motor.  \n\nTime’s now too short where it once was long. Luck ran empty, in this situation I don’t belong.  \n\nKnees draw inward, as I squat towards the key. Teary eyes water, and blurred vision obstructs me.  \n\nRecounting a child's woeful elementary fear. Cold doom ensues, as dreaded wet end draws near.  \n\nEffort waning from straining, only wishing to flee. Look around quickly making sure no one would see.  \n\nIs the future decided or has free-will sealed my fate? Stuck at my front door, needing to get in and urinate.  \n\nHopefully I’ll forget this, with some shots and beer. Exasperated, I prepare to go, *when the lock’s click I hear!*    \n\nFreely, traveling spatially.  \nGreet my Family with a yelp and a glance.  \nOnward to end this overdue dance.  \n\nFreely, embracing urgency,  \nMy bathroom ajar. In privacy, there’s peace.  \nEngorged anxiety flows away with release.","createdAt":"2022-08-21T05:10:01.905Z","updatedAt":"2022-09-16T04:08:33.676Z","publishedAt":"2022-08-21T05:10:03.270Z","featured":false}}]},"art_categories":{"data":[]}}},{"id":5,"attributes":{"title":"Behold This.","description":"I am Christopher Antreasian, a web developer and life long artist.
